*Xeno Lumus*

![[lumen.png|500]]
The Lumen are a new race to join the universal community. Discovered by the EDEN corporation in #todo on [[HD8030 A]], a water world that EDEN was prospecting for viable fusion fuel to extract and sell in the interstellar market.

The Lumen are most closely related to jellyfish in their biological structure. Lacking a skeleton, and amourphous in composition. They have evolved to best suit the depths of their home world.
They have a porous membrane that they can allow matter to pass through, into their acidic interior. This is how they eat, breaking apart their food without a stomach.

The lumen have excellent vision, and communicate with bioluminescent dancing with one another. They can vocalise and mimic sounds, though are more attuned to the lower end of the audible spectrum, and struggle to hear with the same clarity as humans. Higher pitched sounds may not be picked up at all.

They have a strong sense of touch, and completely lack a sense of smell.

Lumen are adapted to high pressure environments, their bodies can exert incredible amounts of compressive strength, though they struggle under tensional loads. Low pressure environments can lead to their bodies losing the ability to hold itself together, and the vaccum of space is incredibly lethal to Lumen. For this reason they are highly sought after as labour in mining, industrial, and construction enterprises.

Despite their vulnerability to the vacuum of space, many Lumen have left the safety of their home to discover what lies beyond in the sky above, and can be found in many places within the galaxy.

Their level of cognition is considered generally lesser than humans, though their understanding mimicry of patterns is unparralel. And are generally considered to be a more cohesive and cooperative race than humans.

Lumen reproduce as a collective, back on their home planet. There are designated growing pools, where Lumen can rejuvinate themselves, or donate matter to create new lumen. Due to their ability to reform their body from new matter, they have no limit to how long they could theoretically live for, and some claim to have lived for many hundreds of human years.

Lumen can be formed from various distict groupings of proteins and enzymes, which can be indicated by the color of the lumen. These various chemical makeups can result in different physical and mental phenotypes. Below are the known colours of lumen.
