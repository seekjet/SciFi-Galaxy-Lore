## The Sexes, and their Differences

### Jajko (The Donors)
Jajko are the sex that fertilise the eggs of the Dt'tkoxtka.
The smallest of the three sexes, the Jajko stand around 5ft in size. They mature in 4 years, and have a lifespan of just 25 years. The Jajko are considered the equivalent of the 'drone' sex, and make up the bulk of the unskilled workforce within Vk'dxud society. They are considered lesser than their two other sexes, and have little to no personal rights within their family unit.

### Dt'tkoxtka (The Layers)
Dt'tkoxtka are the sex that lay fertilised eggs into the Dt'tka.
In size, they sit between the other sexes, standing on average 11ft tall. They are considered the most physically inclined of the three sexes, featuring an enlargened thorax, and a higher muscle to weight ratio than the other two sexes. Historically, this has led to the Dt'tkoxtka to be the dominant sex in the warrior/militaristic caste. They take 17 years to mature into adulthood, and generally have a livespan of 80 years. They do not go through menopause like humans do.

### Dt'tka (The Stewards)
Dt'tka are the sex that nurse the fertilised eggs in their bodies, producing young.
Physically the largest sex, standing on average 12ft tall, the Dt'tka feature an extensively elargened abdomen, and a comparitively reduced thorax. The Dt'tka would be the highest tier in Vk'dxud caste society.
The vk'dxud young's physical attributes and sex are not determined by their genetic code, instead Dt'tka can choose the biological outcome of their young by selecting what nutrients they ingest during their young's gestation. They hold an important role in their family unit, as they must select what their family needs in terms of new young, and what that young will do in the larger society.
The Dt'tka take the longest to mature into their adult stage, fully maturing around 30 years of age. Thus losing a Dt'tka is a huge blow to a family. On average they live 180 years, though can only bear children until around their 80s.
The Dt'tka feature the largest antennae of the three sexes, allowing them to easily communicate with all within their household.
