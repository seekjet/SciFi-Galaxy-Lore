Aka 7 Pegasi d, the fourth planet of the 7 Pegasi system. Janariss is a rocky bleak world that lacks a magnetic core, and so its residents must live underground for their day to day lives.

Janariss did once have life on its surface, though that was millions of years ago. However the remaining oil and polymer pockets from these times can still be found deep under the surface of the planet, and large petrochem and pharmaceutical companies have set up here to produce their goods.
