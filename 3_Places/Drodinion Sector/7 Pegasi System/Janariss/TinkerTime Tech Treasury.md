### Various handheld firearms

#### Gauss Gun
(300 MDR - triple use)
A gun based off of electromagnetic technology and Newton's law of conservation of momentum. This shoots heavy slugs at incredible speed, and is generally used in an anti-material role. This gun grants a +4 to shoot attack, but requires the user to charge the internal capacitors for a round before firing

#### Wrist Needler
(75 MDR - single use)
A rather thick bracelet that when activated reveals hundreds of tiny needles ready to fire out from it's surface
Allows the user to make a shoot attack roll against all individuals within a 6 meter (20ft) radius. The user cannot exclude individuals in this radius.

## Offered Implants
Electronic neural Interface (ENI) Allows the user to interface with nearby electronics wirelessly, make calls in their head, plug in data chips and experience their content. It's like putting your phone in your head! Discrete and nearly invisible, aside from the pair of ports high on the side of the neck these ports work the same as phone data ports, and can take the same modification inserts

## Datachip Inserts
These devices by [[FI Nanotechnology]] can plug directly into your phone or ENI, adding or modifying features, storing data, etc. Kind of function like a usb port.

#### Lie Detector
(Price 100MDR - triple use)
This DCI increases your level of success by 1 for a roll when attempting to discern a person's truthfulness. Good for those that aren't psychic and want to read the emotions of society's more shady individuals

#### Backup Helmet
(Price 50MDR - ENI only, single use)
This DCI detects any sudden loss in pressure and deploys an inflatable clear helmet around the user. A great backup plan for the everyday spacer!

#### Heartbeat Sensor
(price 50MDR - dual use)
A mod that uses TL4 technology to scan a 20 meter (65 feet) radius around the user for lifesigns. It shows any living lifeforms as blips on a phone screen, or as a physical outline if used in an ENI A scan lasts for 1 minute. Also lets the user read their own heartbeat for free!

#### Natalie's Fervor
(50 MDR - single use)
An insert that generates a fantastic unread romance novel custom written for the user. The novel briefly inspires the user on more flirtatious interaction. For a day after reading the novel, the user gains a +2 on any Persuade rolls made against a person of gender the user finds desirable. (if the user finds multiple genders attractive then they must specify one upon insert).

#### Britannica
(30 MDR - triple use)
Ever been somewhere out of reach of the internet and need to know something now? Why not take all common knowledge with you everywhere?
Britannica is an encyclopedia of basic knowledge of the galaxy in a DCI. Using this dci negates the need to make a roll to discover any information considered common knowledge by interstellar citizens. This includes, but is not limited to, planet/star names and aliases, basic attributes of celestial bodies (volcanic, desert, ice, gas, inhabited/uninhabited, atmospheric composition, etc), location technology/wealth levels, factions and their backgrounds, and prominent figures (both alive and dead) 

#### Flashlight
(10MDR - triple use)
A simple DCI that provides great illumination in the color of the user's choice up to 15 meters (50ft) away for 10 minutes. Batteries non-rechargeable.
