The Oasis is a well-protected enclave within the [[Stavoff]] region of [[Houtu]], owned and fortified by Mad Muffin Inc. It features advanced water purification systems, green spaces, and sheltersâ€”an environment starkly different from the surrounding harsh wasteland. Its main feature is the vast artificial lake it uses to contain all of the pumped groundwater used by [[Muffin Mad Inc]].

This is the location of the personal estate of [[The Muffin Man]].
