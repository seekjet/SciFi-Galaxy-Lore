### The Cult of the Abyssal Core

#### **Overview:**

The Cult of the Abyssal Core is a secretive, tightly-knit community established on a remote mining planet, far from the reaches of civilization. The cult is centered around the operations of an ancient mining facility located deep within the planet's crust, where rare and valuable minerals are extracted. However, the isolation and harsh conditions have allowed for a much darker and more insidious belief system to take root. The cult is led by a charismatic and manipulative figure named Harrison Gudara, a former mining foreman who became obsessed with the strange, unearthly phenomena that began to occur as the mining operations delved deeper into the planet’s core.

#### **Cult Beliefs:**

The cult's beliefs are built around the idea that the planet itself is a sentient entity, which they refer to as "The Abyssal Core." They believe that by mining deeper and extracting its "blood" (the rare minerals), they can commune with this entity and gain unimaginable power. The deeper they mine, the closer they believe they come to a state of spiritual and physical perfection, as they become more attuned to the will of the Abyssal Core.

Harrison Gudara, once a pragmatic and down-to-earth leader, became obsessed with the strange signals and visions that plagued the mining crew as they dug deeper. He interpreted these phenomena as the voice of the Abyssal Core, calling him to lead his followers on a path to enlightenment through sacrifice and devotion. Over time, the cult’s rituals became increasingly bizarre and dangerous, involving bloodletting, the consumption of the planet's minerals in small, ritualistic doses, and the eventual offering of lives to "feed" the core.

#### **Daily Life:**

The cultists live in a state of constant fear and reverence, believing that any deviation from Gudara's teachings will incur the wrath of the Abyssal Core. They work tirelessly in the mines, pushing the limits of human endurance, as they see their labor as a form of worship. Their day-to-day lives are governed by strict rituals and schedules, with even minor infractions leading to severe punishments, or even sacrificial offerings.

Cult members are kept in line through a combination of psychological manipulation, isolation from the outside world, and the promise of spiritual ascension. They are led to believe that the outside world is corrupt and that only by staying within the confines of the cult can they achieve true enlightenment. The constant physical and mental strain keeps them in a state of compliance, too exhausted and brainwashed to question Gudara’s authority.

#### **Recruitment of Outsiders:**

Despite their isolation, the cult occasionally seeks out outsiders to join their ranks, particularly those who seem unskilled or downtrodden. These individuals are seen as blank slates—easily manipulated and shaped into devout followers. The cult values such outsiders because they are less likely to question Gudara's teachings and more likely to embrace the cult’s way of life out of desperation.

Additionally, the cult believes that the Abyssal Core favors those who come to it with pure intentions—people who are uncorrupted by the greed and sins of the outside world. An outsider with little professional skill is seen as humble and untainted, making them an ideal candidate for indoctrination. Gudara often convinces these new recruits that they were "called" to the planet by the Abyssal Core itself, and that their lack of worldly skills is actually a sign of their spiritual potential.

Furthermore, such individuals are often more grateful for the sense of purpose and belonging that the cult provides, making them fiercely loyal once indoctrinated. The cult sees these new members as fresh blood, essential to continuing their mission to uncover the secrets of the planet and fulfill Gudara’s vision.
