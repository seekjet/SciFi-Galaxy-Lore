Xel'thar is the first point of contact for outsiders who arrive at the mining facility. His role as a concierge involves greeting new arrivals, easing them into the cult’s strange customs, and assessing their potential for recruitment. Xel'thar’s demeanor is surprisingly calm and polite, masking the cruelty and cunning beneath his reptilian exterior. His loyalty to Harrison Gudara is absolute, seeing the cult leader as a savior who gave him purpose and identity after his transformation.
    
- **Background and Role:** Xel'thar was once a low-ranking miner who volunteered for Gudara’s early genetic experiments in a desperate attempt to escape the brutal labor conditions. The transformation left him physically powerful but mentally subservient, deeply ingrained with the cult's doctrine. He genuinely believes that his form is a gift from the Abyssal Core, and he is fervently devoted to bringing new souls to the fold.
