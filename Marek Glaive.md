- Marek is relatively new to the cult, having been recruited by Xel'thar during a routine scouting mission. Unlike the more hardened cultists, Marek still harbors doubts about the cult’s practices, though he keeps these thoughts to himself out of fear of retribution.
    
- **Background and Role:** Marek joined the cult after being stranded on the planet following a mining accident that killed the rest of his crew. With nowhere else to go and no skills beyond basic labor, he reluctantly accepted the cult’s hospitality, grateful for the shelter and food they provided. However, Marek’s reluctance to fully commit to the cult’s beliefs has not gone unnoticed. Gudara, always in need of sacrifices to appease the Abyssal Core, has marked Marek as the next offering. Unaware of his fate, Marek is being closely watched by Elara and other cult members, who are preparing him—mentally and physically—for the ritual that will end his life.
