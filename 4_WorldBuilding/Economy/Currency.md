Currency is broken down into two categories, centralized and decentralized.

### Centralized
Centralized currency is a currency that is distributed and curated by one or more banks. Its value is generally far more stable than decentralized currencies, and more vendors will accept it as payment, however its transactions are tracked, and the operating companies have complete control of the accounts that use their currency

The most proliferate centralized currency is the Martian Digital Renminbi (MDR)

Prices for goods are roughly a 5th of what they would be in today's AUD
### Decentralized
Decentralized currency is a currency that is not maintained or curated by any one entity. Its transactions are not facilitated by a company, and accounts are solely controlled by the end user. This freedom and privacy comes at the cost at large and frequent swings in the value of the currency. It should be noted that the companies that proliferate centralized currencies deeply discourage the used of decentralized currency, and do not support the transaction of decentralized currency and centralized currency within their system, so any transaction between one and another has no protection or guarantee that both parties will get paid during the transaction.

The most common decentralized currency is Shiba Inu (SHIB)
