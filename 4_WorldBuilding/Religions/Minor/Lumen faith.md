make a new color of lumen
space is terrifying
give back to the pool
protect the pool

eel bad

planet could once a long time ago host other land based species
dont know what happened to them, but their relics of the past can be found beneath risen sea levels

priests within the higher lumen faith can call events that will benefit the lumen people as a whole
these would also act as the cultural heads

lumen have strong opinions on these cultural leaders, and will zealously protect them and their honor.

a defective lumen within here is a very bad outcome, as they will not have the interest of the whole in mind

Gudu is the title for one of these elders
