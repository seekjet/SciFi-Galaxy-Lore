People who have committed themselves to the wonders of the Way, and all the beauty it brings.
Generally corrupted by the extradimensional influence of witch space itself, the followers of the way generally are made up of small cult groups, trying to increase its influence here within our reality.
This might be through reinterpretations of existing religions, like for instance, believing that the way is heaven, and the creatures within gods angels, and they might want to either bring people to it, or bring it to people.
They might also see that the corruption helps people. It allows the sick and infirm to recover from their ailments, and return to full physical capability, they may have been enlightened with knowledge that is only understood with their twisted views on everything, or they might simply be so corrupted that they are a simple vessel for witch space to have its way over them.
