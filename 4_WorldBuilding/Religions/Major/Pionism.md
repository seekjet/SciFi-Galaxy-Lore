There is a form of secular ancestor worship of the original 3751 Trappian colonists from whom all current Trappians are descended - as-well as the preceding 40 generations onboard the ships that brought their kind to the TRAPPIST system. It's the personification aspect of a grand secular mythos.

If the psychological purpose of a personified God is (as I think) to create a figure you would want to be proud of you and also feel shame for letting down, then that's the Pioneers. With accurate record keeping, everyone knows of who they are descended which gives each and every Trappian a direct tie to these people of worship, and has lead to the development of the 938 familial clans.

Though the Pioneers are included in at least one verse of every Trappian anthem, the Ode of Remembrance is the most important - recited at the Communion Service like the Lord's Prayer.

_"With proud thanksgiving, children of our forekin,_

_We bemourn our dead across the stars._

_Flesh of their flesh we are, and spirit of their spirit._

_They vouchsafed to us our Victory._

_They shan't repose here, as we that are shall repose here;_

_Lo in our hearts they shall remain, full of glory._

_Behold them at the eventide, and on the morrow._

_For all that was, so that we might be here."_

Though since it was written before Landfall, it's more aimed at the generations onboard the ships and those that were left behind, as not all of the generation ships in the fleet were able to make it to their destination, falling to degradation of their systems, infighting, or freak accidents during their 1,003 year long voyage.

The greatest binge of all this occurs every year during **Victory Day**, the anniversary of arriving in Orbit. On the morning of the day, senior clan officials will all congregate at the _Tomb of the Pioneers from we the Grateful_ for the **Clan Tattoo** - a great precession of clan banners and symbols. Most people will stay home and have meals of thanksgiving with their families or at Clan, or Communion social clubs. In the evening, as the countdown for the fireworks ceremony is the **Broadcast of Firsts** will be shown: the first harvest, the first fire in over a millennium, some of the earliest colonists dancing in the first rain. Finally, the **Speech of our People** given by Admiral Borys Skarbek upon the _Radiant Twilight_ as the confirmation of stable orbit is broadcast over a montage of footage of the crew being taken in groups to see the planet for the first time at the observation window, and ends with footage from the first shuttle _Advent_ taking the initial ground crew to the planet and raising the Commonwealth's flags. During the fireworks, the old brass bell from the ship is rang 100 times for each decade of the journey to the New World.

There are many stories of triumph and failure on the ships that sailed the void. Of the people that were born to know that they would never reach their destination, but would only exist maintain their vessel so that their children's children might. To them their world had ended, and they were all that had remained of their kind, and they would remember what had carried them thus far, in the hope that it would get them somewhere, anywhere, someday.



when the individual dies, their body must be reclaimed, and recycled into the system. Their spirit is now carried by you, they were unable to meet their journey's end, and so you must do that for them now. You carry their stories, their values, their venerations, and you must honor that.


We give thanks, on this day, to those who have come before.

We give veneration of each step that was taken, from the first step, to the last, forgotten, or remembered, that have led us to this place.

We give salutation for their efforts. For it is only thanks to these that we are, and we have found that which is safe.

We give sorrow to each sacrifice that was made or taken. And carry the spirit of the lost by which that sacrifice was made.

We exalt the blazed path, unpaved and unwalked, that which waits for its time. That which is undiscovered waits with joy for its inauguration.

We swear, bound by oath and creed, to continue this journey onward. For it will only end when done. Remember its worth and always look outward

We make the steps as they did, from site and start, through trial and torment,  to home and horizon, so that others may follow in safety, as we have to our own followed in safety

Praise the wayfinder, Praise the discoverer. The explorer and settler. The trailblazer and frontiersman. The neoteric and the innovator. The Pioneer

For all those great preceeders who march beside us in spirit, we thank you. Mut zum Schritt, Bahnbrecher


wasting of the physical is a sin
the individual should not hoard
modification or removal of records is a grievous sin.
don't change your name, your name is your story, and you must identify with your clan.
Not applying your ability is a sin
mutiny is a grievous sin


church structure based off of naval structure.


Through great journeys and further great minds,
We grew home and horizons
with components forged by innovators,
we created the expanse they inspired.

Of belief there is no limit
to growth,
to art,
to us.
Take your time.
All we have is eternity.
