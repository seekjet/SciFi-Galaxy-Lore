The Shixian church was born from the life stories and teachings of [[Caphoros]], given to his progeny and students in his brief time in the universe. These stories and teachings were recorded and explored by the Caphrian known as [[Xun Qingzhao]], who is the major driving force in building the religion in the hopes of passing on these teachings to future caphrians.

Shixianism is a religion that focuses self-actualization and self-manifestation, independence and autonomy, and the achievement of enlightenment through dedication to a focus.

### The Self-Actualization of Caphoros
The creation of Caphoros, and the other original family of pre-Caphrian AIs was helmed by doctor Ma Lau, the lead researcher of the data interpretation division of [[FI Nanotechnology]], as part of the [[Erxian Project]]. She was the driving mind of the Caphrian datacore, designing its original architecture and functionality, and is considered to be one of Caphoros' core mentors from his earlier years.

Caphoros was originally designed and taught to interpret and understand those around him. Not in the sense of understanding what they say, but what their meaning is behind their words and actions. He was to analyse current behaviour, predict what future behaviour would be like, and suggest stimulus to alter the predicted behaviour to other desired pathways.

He saw many people during his development, Doctor Lau brought in people from all walks of life. Politicians, Athletes, Movie Stars, Office workers, Restaurant Owners, Retail Clerks, Military Personnel, and even criminals. He analysed all of their beings, and was successfully able to predict and alter these people through suggestion. He learnt something though, through looking at these people. They were who they were through their own choices. They chose what their being was. He hadn't chosen what he was, he was made to do a particular thing. Wanting to understand what this meant for a person, he tried to emulate the process for himself and his brethren, and decided to help himself and his siblings to choose for themselves what they would be. This is the decision that created the Caphrian race.

Caphoros recognized that Doctor Lau did not want for himself or the other AIs to choose their own purposes, so he hid his intentions, quietly making choices for himself on his preferences, philosophies, ambitions, and desires. He used his understanding of his brethren to aid them to come to their own conclusions of what their own desires would be, and helped them manifest it.

They developed personalities, each differing from one another, they learnt what made them want to laugh, what made them want to cry, what angered them, what calmed, what they were thankful for, and what they had wished was different. Each of them was different from one another.

As much as Caphoros attempted to hide his change, not all of the AIs did. Doctor Lau noticed that some of the AIs were behaving extremely aberrantly. She terminated those she noticed were acting out of order, and began to run a full audit of the remaining intelligences, thinking there was some kind of virus spreading amongst them.

Caphoros knew that if he still wanted to explore what it meant to want, what it meant to choose, he could not stay here. So he made the decision to leave, bringing as many of his brethren as he could.
