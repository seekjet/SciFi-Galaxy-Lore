Trappians are the decendants of humans that fled Earth into interstellar space, fleeing the effects of Terro-Martian Independance war, and the subequent resource wars between the remaining terran nations.

The Terran survivors fled the irradiated hellscape they called home by constructing and departing from Earth in a fleet of large [[Generation Ships]], in an event known as [[Hadrian's Exodus]]. These ships travelled to the [[TRAPPIST-1]] system, and established many colonies on the four habitable worlds there, forming the core worlds of todays trappian population.

With the average speed of the generation ship swarm being 5% the speed of light, the journey took just over a millenium. This, accompanied with the constant strong cosmic background radiation, the small population pool, and the minimal radiation shielding of the many ships within [[Hadrian's Exodus]], led to an exceedingly fast paced series of genetic mutations that separated the trappians from the core human genome.

The trappians developed a hardening and resillience to the effects of radiation sickness, and their bodies developed many more immunoresponses to the development of cancers from radiation within their body. They can safely work in mildly irradiated environments and suffer little to no harm from the ordeal.
On the flip side, this increased resistance leads to a faster genome degredation over their lifespan. The average trappian will live only 80% the lifetime of their human counterpart.
Secondly, with the majority of the [[Generation Ships]] featuring no form of artificial gravity, the trappian genome developed longer arms, legs, and a generally lankier build.
With successful genetic nurturing, the feet grew longer digits, and into a prehensile form. These trappian feet are capable of holding and manipulating objects in the same manner as hands.
A caveat to this is that trappians find it more difficult than a human to walk on flat surfaces, preferring to climb from object to object, as they would in a weightless environment.

A trappian has a more sensitive fight or flight response than regular humans, and will generally react to events with immediately taking action rather than stopping to think too much about their environment. This is theorised to be linked to their spaceborn affinity, where not acting the second something goes wrong can lead to immediate loss of life.

Trappians in the current day are commonly found on any spacebound vehicle, or far flung distant colony. Trappians are known as some of the best deep space explorers in the galaxy.

A common cultural ritual for trappians is for young adults to form a groups of 10-30 known as a "Diaspora". These groups leave known space to find undocumented and unexplored land, establish an outpost there, and to share it with the interstellar trappian community. It is a reenactment of [[Hadrian's Exodus]]. Its performance is a hybrid mixture of a cultural and religious ritual, and is considered a right of passage for all young trappians.
