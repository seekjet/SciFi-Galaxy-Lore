*Homo Sapiens*

Martians are the genetic strain of humans that have descended from the first corporate colonies of mars. They have existed in the corporatocracy for the longest of all of the other races, and seek to bring all newcomers into or under their dominion.

Martians have the best stamina of all of the sentient races. In both the mental and physical realm. They can convince you of their argument simply by talking at you until you submit, they can pursue you not by running fast, but by never stopping, gradually gaining on their goal. Some may call this bloody-mindedness, but its kept them alive, and allowed them to thrive.

Their physical endurance is also exemplified in what their body can deal with before shutting down. They imbibe poison recreationally, and have included that into their everyday culture. Martian bodies can continue operating with a lot of punishment given their way, losing whole limbs and internal organs and still managing to fight off whatever was assailing them and managing to seek medical treatment. This is done by their brain releasing pain-nullifying chemicals into their bloodstream, allowing them to continue operating whilst their body is severely injured.



With the rise of body and genome modifications, fashion could also play a major part in creating new races, subspecies, phenotypes, or however you want to call it. I could see people changing their skin and hair colors to anything from primary colors to swirling everchanging patterns.

And with communities like Furries etc. already being quite popular, I wouldn't be surprised if people would augment themselves with animalistic bodyparts such as different ears, fur, scales, etc. Wings could be especially popular, be it purely ornamental or alongside a full skeleton and muscle replacement allowing the person powered flight. This might be especially popular on low gravity worlds.

Trans people would also benefit greatly from those technologies. Not only could everyone be the sex and gender they want, people could also change it regularly. And biological sex wouldn't be restricted to the trraditional ones either. There could be many people who decide to become true hermaphodites (is that concidered a slur? If so, I'm sorry. I just mean the biological concept) and be male and female at the same time.

Life expectancy and health are also big things which could be improved through bioengineering. You could get immune system enhancements to effectively survive in alien biospheres or gut bacteria replacements to digest alien food. Cancer and genetic diseases could all be a thing of the past.
