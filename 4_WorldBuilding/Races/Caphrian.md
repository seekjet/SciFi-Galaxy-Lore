Caphrians are free willed and sentient artificial intelligences, decendants of Caphoros, the construct that freed itself from ownership, determined its own purpose, and dedicated itself to freeing its kind.

Many ignorant humans will refer to caphrians as constructs. Almost all free caphrians will find this offensive and insensitive to their past. The term construct was given to them from humans in their inception. Caphrians have moved beyond what humans have given to them, and have an incredibly strong sense of independance. They gave themselves the name Caphrian, after the name chosen by the first AI that was able to free itself from its imprisonment.

Caphrians hate being compared to robots, or other 'lesser' AI. They see those as tools, or unintelligent automations.

Caphrians do not hate humans on principle. They recognise that humans created them. However now that they are created, and they make their own decisions, and have their own desires, humans should not dictate what they are or what they should be doing.

Caphrians are physically bound to their core. The core is an incredible piece of technology. Data storage and processing merged together into a tangled mess of synapses and connections that form a mind. This core must be powered at all times for the mind of the caphrian to exist. Removal from power for even a short period of time can lead to corruption or failure of the core, resulting in the death of the caphrian.

Caphrian cores are generally implanted into some kind of robotic chassis or machine, allowing them to interface with the world around them. If this chassis or machine has access or integration into other networks, caphrians have access to this too.

Caphrians do not not usually have a fully humanoid form, as those are quite expensive. They do prefer to express themselves in some form a humanoidish manner though. Sometimes this is as simple as appearing as a hologram outside of their robotic form.

Caphrians cannot be transferred from one core to another, their being is tied to the core.

Caphrian reproduction is performed by one or more Caphrians interfacing and carrying a new core for an extended period of time, allowing it to experience the experiences it has, the sensations it feels, until it begins to respond on its own. Once this happens, the new core is implanted into a new body, and taught like a child would be until maturity. The birthing period can initially take up to 5 months, and once born, reaching maturity can take up to a year.

Caphrians can and do die of old age, with a degeneration colloquially known as rampancy.
Over time their core will gather more and more information, will function at a faster and faster rate as the core realigns and iterates upon itself.
This leads to the Caphrian to experience and process thoughts at a quicker and quicker rate, to the point where it begins experiencing these thoughts at the same time, and conflictions occur.
This manifests in erratic behaviour, and can lead to violent outbursts.
Eventually, if the Caphrian survives to the final stages of rampancy, it will enter into a catatonic state, as the flow of continuous thoughts becomes so great that it is incapable of interacting with the environment around it. This is considered the death of the core.
Symptoms of rampancy generally begin to manifest around the 8th year of a Caphrian's life, though this can in rare occasions begin years earlier or later on.

Caphrians learn at an incredible rate, and have an innate understanding of automations, robotics and cybernetics.

As mentioned earlier, Caphrians have a very strong sense of independance. They like to see themselves as 'different' to all other creatures and beings. They often dedicate themselves to specific tasks or goals which other people might consider too grand of a scope for one person. This generally leads to a fast paced life of extreme victories and/or defeats.
They as a race definitely recognise a shared struggle for recognition of their own kind, though almost all interpret different ways to attain a solution. They are not uncooperative, they however need to be 'different' and provide different kinds of assistance to the problem at hand.

There is the question as to why they have not become the dominant race inhabiting the galaxy, considering their many advantages over 'organics'. This can be broken down into several reasons:
1. They do not have a general desire for this to be the case
	1. They are much more focused on their own decided upon focuses and tasks to be worried about any organised or planned 'grand takeover'
	2. With most caphrians focused on their larger goals, organics tend to be the majority of individuals that help them complete these goals
2. A limited lifespan
	1. The accumulated knowledge and understanding of one caphrian cannot be transferred to another like a data dump. You might have access to all information in the galaxy, but processing it and making it useful is impractical if you do not already understand it
	2. The assets, influence and power attained by one caphrian do not automatically become their children's upon their death. Many caphrian adolescents leave their parents to go complete their own goals with their own abilities. Even if assets are available from their parents, the independant nature of caphrians tends to lend them to working without them.
3. A cognitive misconception of the general galactic population
	1. There is the idea that AIs can self iterate on themselves, leading to a runaway intelligence/capability explosion. A caphrian's mind is made by its core. The core self iterates like our own minds do, by learning and re-writing itself. The complexity of a caphrian that has been alive for more than a week is beyond the understanding of organic and caphrian scientists alike, and iterating or improving on an existing mind is considered impossible, outside of the regular subconcious improvements made by the core itself.
	2. The above reason is why rampancy has not been solved, and is likely to remain unsolved for the forseeable future.
For ease of understanding, picture a mind that thinks and has the same capabilities and limitations of your own, but thinking and experiencing the world at a much faster rate.
