## The Sexes, and their Differences

### Jajko (The Donors)
Jajko are the sex that fertilise the eggs of the Dt'tkoxtka.
The smallest of the three sexes, the Jajko stand around 5ft in size. They mature in 4 years, and have a lifespan of just 25 years. The Jajko are considered the equivalent of the 'drone' sex, and make up the bulk of the unskilled workforce within Vk'dxud society. They are considered lesser than their two other sexes, and have little to no personal rights within their family unit.

### Dt'tkoxtka (The Layers)
Dt'tkoxtka are the sex that lay fertilised eggs into the Dt'tka.
In size, they sit between the other sexes, standing on average 11ft tall. They are considered the most physically inclined of the three sexes, featuring an enlargened thorax, and a higher muscle to weight ratio than the other two sexes. Historically, this has led to the Dt'tkoxtka to be the dominant sex in the warrior/militaristic caste. They take 17 years to mature into adulthood, and generally have a livespan of 80 years. They do not go through menopause like humans do.

### Dt'tka (The Stewards)
Dt'tka are the sex that nurse the fertilised eggs in their bodies, producing young.
Physically the largest sex, standing on average 12ft tall, the Dt'tka feature an extensively elargened abdomen, and a comparitively reduced thorax. The Dt'tka would be the highest tier in Vk'dxud caste society.
The vk'dxud young's physical attributes and sex are not determined by their genetic code, instead Dt'tka can choose the biological outcome of their young by selecting what nutrients they ingest during their young's gestation. They hold an important role in their family unit, as they must select what their family needs in terms of new young, and what that young will do in the larger society.
The Dt'tka take the longest to mature into their adult stage, fully maturing around 30 years of age. Thus losing a Dt'tka is a huge blow to a family. On average they live 180 years, though can only bear children until around their 80s.
The Dt'tka feature the largest antennae of the three sexes, allowing them to easily communicate with all within their household.

## The Familial Unit
The rd'tzina is one of the most important social groupings in Vk'dxud society. This is the term that denotes the family unit. The members of the rd'tzina all come from a common ancestral decendant.
The rd'tzina generally consists of roughly 30 members, made up of 1-3 Dt'ka, 6-10 Dt'tkoxtka and 15-20 Jajko. Generally the family is headed by the eldest Dt'tka (in rare cases this may be a Dt'tkoxtka), though decision making and strategy planning is shared amongst its members.
Larger family sizes have been recorded, but are rare, as larger units generally fall to infighting, and eventually separate into two rival familial units.
The bonds of family are incredibly strong within the Vk'dxud. The family's survival is your survival. If the family thrives, you thrive with it. The family shares its accomplishments with you, and you must share your accomplishments with it. Failure to perform your familial duties can lead to expulsion from the rd'tzina, which is a terrible place to be socially. Without a family, you have no credibility to your competence, no backing, and no future prospects. With these properties, most vk'dxud are dissuaded from interacting with these individuals. These people are called zrodzny, or 'shadow-cast'.

## Reproduction
Reproduction for vk'dxud is a four step process that requires all three sexes of the race.
In the first step, the jajko fertilises an egg in the dt'tkoxtka through sexual intercourse.
In the second step, the dt'tkoxtka impregnates the dt'tka with the fertilised egg.
In the third step, the dt'tka feeds on the required nutrients and protiens to shape the young's physical attributes and sex.
In the fourth step, the dt'tka delivers the young.

This process is of course dictated by the rd'tzina, as controlling the development of the young is of social, cultural, political, and potentially religious importance.
When a rd'tzina is decided on adding to its ranks, the dt'tkoxtka of the family seek out mates from other families, and compete with one another to find the most desireable jajko, have sex with them, and secure a fertilised egg. Once this is done, the rd'tzina will decide which of the fertilised eggs they will bring to term, and their dt'tka carrier(s) will be selected. The selected dt'tkoxtka and dt'tka will then have sex to transfer the fertilised egg, and the young will be raised to term.
Yes, since dt'tkoxtka and dt'tka within a familial unit are often siblings or children of one another, incest is standard practice within vk'dxud society. Since the genetic makeup of the dt'tka is not transferred to the young, this does not lead to genetic defects.
