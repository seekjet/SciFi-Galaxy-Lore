## Nameless NPCs

#### Average

- **Competence**: Rank-and-file order-takers, local conscripts, and the like. When in doubt, a nameless NPC is Average.
- **Purpose**: Mostly there to make the PCs look more awesome.
- **Aspects**: One or two.
- **Skills**: One or two Average (+1).
- **Stress**: No stress boxes—a one shift hit is enough to take them out.

#### Fair

- **Competence**: Trained professionals, like soldiers and elite guards, or others whose role in the scene speaks to their experience, such as a sharp-tongued courtier or talented thief.
- **Purpose**: Drain a few of the players’ resources (one or two fate points, stress boxes, possibly a mild consequence).
- **Aspects**: One or two.
- **Skills**: One Fair (+2), and one or two Average (+1).
- **Stress:** One stress box (e.g. 1[ ])—a two shift hit is enough to take them out.

#### Good

- **Competence**: Tough opposition, especially in numbers.
- **Purpose**: Drain the players’ resources—as Fair, but more so. Provide a decent stumbling block (in numbers) on the way to a more significant encounter.
- **Aspects**: One or two.
- **Skills**: One Good (+3), one Fair (+2), and one or two Average (+1).
- **Stress**: Two stress boxes (e.g. 1[ ], 2[ ])—a three shift hit is enough to take them out.

## Supporting NPCs

Skills for a supporting NPC should follow a [column distribution](https://fate-srd.com/node/1850 "Advancement & Change"). Because you’re only going to define four or five skills, just treat it as one column. If your NPC has a skill at Great, fill in one skill at each positive step below it—so one Good, one Fair, and one Average skill.

- **Skill Levels**: A supporting NPC’s top skill can exceed your best PC’s by one or two levels, but only if their role in the game is to provide serious opposition—supporting NPCs who are allied with the PCs should be their rough peers in skill level. (Another action-adventure trope is to make the “lieutenant” character better than the main villain at combat, contrasting brawn to the villain’s brain.)
- **Concessions**: Supporting NPCs should not fight to the bitter end, given the option. Instead, have them concede conflicts often, especially early in a story, and especially if the concession is something like “They get away.” Conceding like this serves a few purposes. For one, it foreshadows a future, more significant encounter with the NPC. Because conceding comes with a reward of one or more fate points, it also makes them more of a threat the next time they show up. What’s more, it’s virtually guaranteed to pay off for the players in a satisfying way the next time the NPC makes an appearance. “So, Landon, we meet again! But this time it shall not go so easily for you.”

## Major NPCs

They have full character sheets just like a PC does, with five aspects, a full distribution of skills, and a selection of stunts. They are the most significant characters in your PCs’ lives, because they represent pivotal forces of opposition or allies of crucial importance. Because they have a full spread of aspects, they also offer the most nuanced options for interaction, and they have the most options to invoke and be compelled. Your primary “bad guys” in a scenario or arc should always be main NPCs, as should any NPCs who are the most vital pieces of your stories.

Because they have all the same things on their sheet as PCs do, main NPCs will require a lot more of your time and attention than other characters. How you create one really depends on how much time you have—if you want, you can go through the whole character creation process and work out their whole backstory through phases, leaving only those slots for “guest starring” open.
