Fuel used is Helium-3 and Deuterium
Fuel Capacity is Max 120L
Fuel Costs Generally 2 MDR/L
Standard flight of the ship takes 10L per session of use
40L per max jump
30L MDR per 80% jump
10L MDR per 60% & < jump


When performing a roll with the ships systems, the character makes a roll and adds not only their attribute bonus, but the ship's too. 

- Actions are performed with the attribute score of the player and the ship added
- A character can only defend once per exchange with the ship
	- If no crew member is available, the ship rolls to defend with only its attribute score.
	- If the ship cannot allocate stress, and it needs to, it is taken out, and is no longer capable of performing offensive or defensive action
- When a ship takes stress, and generates a consequence, a hazard of similar value is also created. 
	- Hazards cause stress to all that are in the room that they were created within, and also cause stress equal to their value to those who end their turn within the hazard. This stress can be defended against.
	- At the top of turn order, a minor hazard has the 1/4 chance to spread and create another hazard of a similar level to an adjacent room. A moderate acts likewise, and has 1/2 chance to spread, and a severe will spread.
	- Hazards can be mitigated by performing an overcome against their value, when they are mitigated, they are only mitigated for the room the overcome action is made within.


Things that can be done on a ship:
Pilot the ship,
navigate
perform pre-jump calculations
distribute power to specific systems
man weapons if they are installed
discern your opponents ship and its capabilities
control drones if you have a drone bay installed
control and eliminate hazards
communicate with allies / enemies
hack into the enemy's system
create additional power by overcharging the reactor
use active defenses to protect the ship if installed (point defense, active shielding, etc)
jury-rig broken subsystems
pilot secondary vehicle (single occupant fighter) if available
analyse incoming signals or newfound objects
