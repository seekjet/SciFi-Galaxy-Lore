The crew of the [[BSS Only Slightly Bent]] have had an incredible pair of weeks. Meeting eachother. Gaining a ship. Learning to fly. Building relationships. Completing jobs. Getting hurt. Helping each-other through that hurt. Surviving and keeping hope when there ought to be none. Their decisions have already changed thousands of people's lives.



Faith's eyes turn away from the two, focusing on the piloting as Macey assaults Ethan yet again. He shouldn't have disabled their stealth system until they were upon the other crew. He shouldn't help them. But she knows why he does, and she respects him for it. She wishes for different circumstances, but her sister is her sister. The dead are the dead. Just keep flying, and maybe she can fly the two of them out of this hole.

Fal reaches over the table and secures another cream puff to go with his tea. The woman across from him does not look up from the second set of dossiers he has given her. She had her own crew in mind of course, but he knows his is better. His lip curls to a smile as she nods. She passes him her requirements. They've changed from last time. The conversation continues. 

A pale faced man, wiry and dirty, desperately pleads his friend Finn for aid outside the Kaleidoscope. It's been days since he has last seen his sister. He's taken every hour he can outside of work searching the endless alleyways of plaza 8, the sinking feeling of despair growing day by day. He fears he may only find her body, or worse, not at all.

Haskell takes another sip of his drink and takes a break from sketching his latest idea. He spies yet another news report on the controversial "bakers" and smiles. Seeing the shocked face of the martian and the elated face of the lumen peering out of the cockpit, the polite vk'dxud, and the charming trappian talking with a few of the reporters. They don't show any footage of V but he knows how much of an effect that night had on her. How much worse she could have been had she not been able to fix /something/ that evening. Their family may still survive.

Nl'Tk'Innitz is in a great mood, her gleaming mandibles splayed widely as she gallops down the hallway. Her sister is back! Oh how she missed her! She can't wait to show her the amazing things she has unwittingly stumbled upon! Nl'Tk'Iltza will be delighted! Or unnerved.. Preferably both! She truly loves her sister. She elevates their family, even when she doesn't mean to. And thus she elevates Nl'Tk'Innitz! She's going to get a promotion for this!

Dr. Warrick presses his fingertips against his eyes, squeezing the bridge of his nose. The memo is but a small item on his screen, but its contents are the only thing filling his mind. Violently, he punches through the screen, shattering the glass, cutting his arm in the process. He stands, stepping back abruptly, shocked at his own lack of composure. The pain sears up the length of his arm, but it doesn't quell his anger for her and them alike. Idiots.

Bodey feels weird and confused, and a little unsure of what to do. His sergeant is angry, but not with him. She keeps telling him that Redline must have set them up. That Consec's not as incompetent as they say they are.. She's also worried. Her brother has to look after their father alone now, and she knows he has even less available time than her.. He tried to offer her his jelly coffee, but she didn't want it, which doesn't make any sense at all. He doesn't like knowing she feels this way. He's got to find a way to make her feel better. Maybe she'll want to watch the game with him. 

Soos looked at the pile of Explogex and frowned. They said they would come back. We said we would wait. One relies on the other. She hasn't had to rely on others for a long time. It irritates her. They could be lying. But the blue wanted to help her free their kind, and that makes sense. She pushes her skull out and into her hands, so that she can look back into its eye holes. lying? She absorbs her skull back into her head, and looks again to the explogex. They will wait another day.

Haruto reads the document, finding its contents rather interesting. Exciting. He can use this, they wont want it to get out. He imagines himself himself a head of a department, making all of his underlings count the beans. He watches from his balcony above them, hears their moans of frustration as they lose count over and over again, forever. It's music to his ears.

Leslie watches as her shipments are torn open by the Redline Security guards. Their contents spilled over the warehouse floor. She shivers, it feels like its her, not the crates, that is being cut open and spilt out. There goes her bonus for the month. She carefully notes the features of the faces of the guards for later.  You don't fuck with a woman and her income.

The short and athletic pale martian with white, dyed blue and pink hair comes running down the alleyway. His similarly colored eyes dart to the green haired, baggy clothed martian, who stops him just short of the door, and reassures him, "He's good, he's contained." Doubt fills Masahiro's mind though. He can see the black smoke billowing out from underneath the door. His friend notes the doubt, and continues; "He's just having a bad day."

Officer Jovaska can't sleep, and in bed is staring at the bulletin that was pushed to her panel. The image of one of the four individuals giving her chills. She relives the moment that woman saved that child. It's no comfort as it only complicates her feelings more. The screen slides over as she has an incoming call from Captain Wolfe. Hesitantly, she answers.

Mr Cuddles lays curled in his mother's lap, softly purring. He knew he was going to find her eventually, but he is so relieved that it's happened. He is never going to let her leave him behind again. It doesn't matter how dangerous it gets. He can handle dangerous, he's helped fly a spaceship!

Mr Li retracts the probe from the man's skull, flicking it clean of the blood and bits of brain he had to move out of the way to get to the man's embedded chip. He may well not have been involved, but he had to make sure. Standing back up he turns to the 6 fearful onlookers. They won't waste his time in the future. "Dump him overboard.. and whichever one of you takes his position, take care to not be outside when your station descends." He begins his walk back to his somewhat repaired ship.
