I want to set up a duo of questions for future down the line in the campaign with each character

I will list these questions:

### Fyria
Central tension
What is the end application of Fyria's work? What is Kirren working towards.
Personal
Will Fyria be able to evade [[Odyssey Genetics]]?

prologue will be the arrival of a series of transport ships of both people and equipment, they will look hurt and damaged, and be rushed off to a more secure area of the site. Dr Autannen will be denied access to these people and equipment.
[[Dr Sethenes Jahi]] was site 33's director of operations, and has been inspired by the idea of Dr Autannen's work, and will be wanting to make sure her work is protected considering these more recent events.
Another individual who may notice something awry will be [[Analyst Sosa Takei]]. They are an internal investigations cybersecurity analyst, and has access to monitoring sensitive files.
### Panini
Central Tension
What the fuck is a way creature?
Personal
Will panini be able to survive this fucked up reality?

prologue session will be one of the more recent shipboard jobs that has gone horribly wrong, with most of the crew passing away, this could be linked to a bad encounter with way creatures in witch space
### Masig 
Central Tension
Will masig be able to overcome the effects of this affliction?
What is this affliction that causes masig to lose control and hurt others?

We will have a scene where Masig and his friend are winding down after a day of work at a local bar. 

[[Felicity Devirve]] will sit down with the pair of Masig and [[Krtz'kulkd'trvet (Sam)]], appearing flirtatious and interested in masig, very forward and pushy, trying to get an opinion of her out of Masig, to where her brother, [[Aiden Devirve]] will step in with his friends, and appear insulted in the manner of speak of his sister. He will demand that masig go out front, where he will say he intends to 'beat his ass'.

### Riley
Central Tension
Who, and for what reason, is searching for this device so desperately?
Personal
Will Kailey's character be able to survive the symptoms of their cybernetics?

prologue: in orbit, going to deal with buyer for the SpACU, deal will go wrong, will require kailey's character to escape.

### Zack's Character
Central Tension
Who is this person who has helped them for no reason? Why did they have to leave so abruptly?
Personal
Will Zack's character be able to adapt to such a dirty lifestyle?
Will they be able to overcome the world shunning them?

Prologue:
They can be found in plaza 8. Hungry and alone. People stare at this person who is so clearly out of place, vulnerable.
- People will try to take advantage of them
- people will try to take what they have, if they have anything.
- People may just try to hurt them because of where they come from.
The name of the gangster harassing them will be [[Tau Yen]]
They can gain the sympathy of an agent of the resistance, [[Magenta Punch]]. Either from being beat upon, or by just how pathetic they are being. Regardless this person will show them kindness, and open their home to them.
They can talk about how all of this system is unfair. How all of these people are just trying to live, and it turns them all against eachother. They can give food, and shelter, though in the night the police will come, and will go to raid their house. They will encourage zack's character to go, and find someone named callum
