- [[Leslie Curtis]] has a deal with the [[Hoàng Thảo Nghi]] to import a bunch of food and medicine
- She is getting these resources from an export train, things her crew have sided away for a while in nooks and crannies within her logistics warehouse. She will want the [[BSS Only Slightly Bent]] to transport these goods to [[Tau Hong Kann]], a captain in the [[Hoàng Thảo Nghi]]
- The party needs to pick these goods up and transport them to the [[Kaleidoscope]], the haven for the [[Hoàng Thảo Nghi]]
- The goods contain enough food to support around 5000 people for 30 days
- Upon leaving the station, the station will request a quick inspection of the ship before it departs, players will have to navigate this complication
- Getting a jump drive will be difficult [[Nick Vale]] Won't have any around, but if the players can get one from [[Angélique Colbert]], he can install it for 40 MDR (if his business manager hears this she will freak and push for the price to go higher) he will be able to tell them that he can install or repair almost anything, given he has the right parts of course.
- [[Angélique Colbert]] will have a jump drive in her scrap yard, of which she can sell for around 50-200 MDR depending on quality, the players will have to find one out in the debris field.
- Decide if you want to do this: have a number of detonations on rejos terminal, orchestrated by [[Gharad PetroChem]], killing a number of its inhabitants, with messages played over the intercom saying that these attacks are set up by the [[People's Liberation Army]]. "The bomb detonations that have just transpired have been conducted by the People's Limberation Army. We are going to continue to hurt the trade of inhumane corporations like "Gharad Petrochem" and "Contispex Pharmaceuticals", and limit their ability to enslave the people they supposedly 'employ'. We would rather die in freedom than live in slavery."
- bombings last 5 months
- This can directly affect the party, having a section of the outer hull blow out with them nearby, blast doors moving to seal to stop the leak in air, and people running to get through them before they close. 
- Inspection after the fact will reveal that the position of the explosions luckily managed to avoid any critical infrastructure, and will be rather quick to repair.
