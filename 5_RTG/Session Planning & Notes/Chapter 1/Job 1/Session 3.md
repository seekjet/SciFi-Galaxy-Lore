## News Broadcast

-- News Intro Music begins, A striking trappian news anchor emerges from behind the Berkata News Network logo flashing by on the screen. A three-dimensional avatar with luminous neon-hued features that slowly transition through gradients of color. Sleek and professional attire adorns the woman as she shuffles a small stack of holo-papers

Neona: Good evening, and welcome to the [[Berkata News Network]]. I'm Neona Nova, bringing you the latest developments in the cosmos.

-- Neona's avatar transitions to the bottom right of the screen as visuals of rejos terminal's bombing appear, the rapid depressurization of sector 8 occurring, with people and equipment being sucked out the side of the station into the cold void, transitioning to people being tended to just outside of the sealed blast door.

Neona: Our top story tonight: The People's Liberation Army strike Rejos Terminal. Again. Earlier today, a devastating bombing rocked the station, claiming the lives of 53 of our coworkers, and leaving many others injured.

-- Cut to footage of injured individuals being tended to by charitable civilians. Fyria's face pops up as she tends to Javar, with close ups to her caring and concerned face.

Anchor: In the aftermath of the attack, brave civilians have stepped up to assist the wounded, beacons of hope amidst the chaos. Their selflessness and determination reminiscent of Seraphina Mercy, and Elias Carr. My brethren, you make your ancestors proud.

-- Cut to an footage of the emblem of the People's Liberation Army in the background. And a the holographic form of a Caphrian Woman with rage in her face, controlling a robotic frame, firing off an array of weapons at unseen foes 

Anchor: Authorities have stated that this heinous act is consistent with previous attacks attributed to the terrorist organization known as the People's Liberation Army. Continuing the organization's steady resurgence in presence since the demise of [[The Firebird]]. However, the perpetrator behind today's bombing remains at large, plunging the station into a state of heightened alert and uncertainty.

-- Cut to Seargant Vale, addressing Rejos's local media in a press conference

Anchor: Despite the efforts of security forces, who are diligently working to apprehend those responsible, there is growing concern and distrust among the public regarding the competence of the station's security personnel, as footage of the bombings location prior to detonation was found to be erased from the terminal's security system.

Cut back to Neona

Anchor: As investigations continue and the search for the perpetrators intensifies, our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this difficult time. We will keep you updated with any further developments on this tragic incident.

-- News Outro Music

Anchor: That concludes our broadcast for tonight. Thank you for joining us on the [[Berkata News Network]]. Stay safe out there.



## Kaleidoscope
The party have taken the cargo to the Kaleidoscope, directed towards a rear service entrance. The goods are unloaded and carted into the facility. [[Finn Li Thien]] Will be there to escort the members of the group into the club, and to meet with [[Tau Hong Kann]], who wants to meet their new delivery drivers.
[[Tau Hong Kann]] wants to ensure that this new crew are to respect the discreteness of their work. He expects them to understand [[Bai Seng]]'s position, and the [[Hoàng Thảo Nghi]]'s control over them. When they make a request, it will be granted, and payment will be made accordingly. To that end he will provide a 50MDR tip to all the members of the crew.
### Fyria's Role within the [[Hoàng Thảo Nghi]]
Tau Hong Kann will clarify with fyria that Tau was her usual contact and supplier from the [[Hoàng Thảo Nghi]], and will ask her if she has seen or heard from Tau Yen recently, and if not, when was the last time she had seen him? He will say that there is an ongoing investigation into Tau Yen's disappearance, and he wouldn't want her to think that they are taking the what is most likely the death of one of their employees not seriously. He suspects that this was no accident, as if it were a body would have been found by now. But he assures her that someone somewhere will have seen something, or more likely a camera will have caught what happened, and it is only a matter of time before they find out exactly what has happened.

He will congratulate her on her new employment, and will then enquire as to what this means with her current synthesis and distribution work. If this means a reduction in terms of her working hours, he will state then that he will reallocate her selling zone to reflect her lesser presence here within plaza 8, but he does expect her to continue to facilitate that area well, as we would not want to upset our customers.

## Mission Rewards:
200 MDR for each reward

+5 reputation for [[Contispex Logistics]] 
-5 reputation for an unmet organisation [[Gharad PetroChem]]
