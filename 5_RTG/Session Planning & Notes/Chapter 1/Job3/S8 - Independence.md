The crew have just been told of callums deathg
they will most likely talk a bit aobut this and what it means for not only themselves, but for bai-seng as a whole

they will want to begin searching for a way to get the [[BSS Only Slightly Bent]] under their own name, though currently according to most compoanies, that is owned by [[Macey Green]].

Avenues for changing this will include:
convincing other companies to recognise their ownership of the ship over macey, or forcing macey to give it up.

Currently, macey green is on her way to collect her property and bounty, though will most likely not find the crew in any reasoinable amount of time, and will need ot go do jobs, so will get distracted from their trail unless sought out.

Bai seng itself will be manned by a bunch of the [[Hoàng Thảo Nghi]], making sure that the other crew dont come to collect on them in the interim

They might want to take up the job for [[Terry]], who wants tome tasti products delivered to three clients in various sensitive situations. he is working in a [[Tasti Corp]]'s offices in [[Takonai City]] on [[Houtu]]in the [[Kandar System]]

Terry has a very tight budget. [[Jazt Pitol]] was hoping that terry would be taken out in the removal of iltza too, though he was deemed to not be responisble by their superiors, and was kept on under Jazt as an underling. He believes that Jazt is trying to hamstring his performance to the point where Jazt will have reason enough to let him go. Terry is trying desperately to fight this as he likes his job, and he wants to undo the harm Jazt has done to iltza, his friend.

[[Warehouse District 68]] - product ingress for [[MegaMart]], workers will be thirsty for their fix
[[Stavoff]] - Lawless district - bring your own security
[[Helvetica Station]] on [[Batibite]] - Gas distilleries, sub-atmosphere, high-pressure environment. dropoff before submersion

[[Jazt Pitol]] was not involved in setting up iltza. He would acknowledge he would say that it would put a lot of pressure off of him, and he will understand why iltza would think he would do suck a thing. But it would have been an awfully risky act. And besides, he already knows he is better than her when it comes to sales. Her competition kept him on his edge, and who is he gonna get that competition now from? terry?
