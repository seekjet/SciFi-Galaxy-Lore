It is currently thursday, and the crew have arrived on the [[Kandar System]].
They have met [[Magic Mike]] and [[Choi Kwan Yeon]] during their shooting of an episode of [[Yeon! Yeon!]]. Learning that [[Magic Mike]] has mystical abilities that might stem from connection to [[witch space]] crystals, and [[Choi Kwan Yeon]] has a strong understanding and affiliation with [[Lumen]].

Following that, the party went to a bar known as [[BevBar]]. There they met [[Hanen]], [[Koyorin Machi]], [[Logan Madell]] and [[Geerten Jovaska]]. Fyria had a strong attraction to [[Geerten Jovaska]], and arranged a date for saturday at 4pm, outside the same bar.
[[Masig Tern (Julian)]] met [[Koyorin Machi]], learning that she has a connection with [[Cathy Caldera]], and is mildly concerned about the woman's whereabouts. She is suspicious of some of her criminal contacts as she knew Cathy knew them too, and wants the crew to snoop around during one of her upcoming meetings with them.
