The crew are heading back from their escapade at [[Helvetica Station]]. They will be meeting one of [[Koyorin Machi]]'s people, [[Dai Fang]] at a [[T4 R&R]] Safehouse number 7. This will have all required amenities provided for people to live off of the grid for the next two days, this will cost in total 200 MDR. The house stops transmissions going into and out of it, and has alerts to the occupants when an unauthorized person enters into the compound's grounds. though the company will not provide manpower to defend the compound, and there are high fees when it comes to damage to the property

The group can encounter a person who is staying in the house across the alley theirs, in a similar situation of hiding out from attention [[Jin Song]], a thief that is part of a interstellar crime group



[[Magic Mike]] will be hanging out with a couple friends at another bar
[[Sun Shuren]] is a Kannushi serving the [[Takonai City Ninomiya]]

Panini wants to:
--look for ship parts/ install them/ blow up our engine with tasty juice.
--find out if the stuff on plaza 8 got done.
--harass Haruto with more confectionery.
--watch tv and make a new DIY kit, probably a wine or beer kit, see if I cna brew that in myself.

Fyria's
-- main thing will be the Geerten date.
-- She'll looking into Trappian culture, if the information is available, though I don't particularly want an abundance of information there. Ignorance on the Holiday would be more interesting.
-- She'll also be trying to find the time to speak to [[Magic Mike]], regarding the Witchery Powers.
	She will want to know how to gain the powers, and mike will in turn tell her the relevance of positivity and what will inevitably happen.
-- She hasn't come to a decision yet re: the Odyssey offer, and she probably won't during this downtime run (think it's going to be something to discuss post the Caldera Job)

The Sig Plan:
- buy hammocks for the ship
- go explore looking for shinto shrine
- if successful will build little personal shrine in cockpit area
	- [[Sun Shuren]] will suggest making a shrine to [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi]], the August star of heaven, the god of heavely chaos, and a prominent part of the heavely lord - [[Ame-no-Minakanushi]] as he will almost certainly be a part of sig's new life
- also maybe touch base with Koyorin re. Monday job
