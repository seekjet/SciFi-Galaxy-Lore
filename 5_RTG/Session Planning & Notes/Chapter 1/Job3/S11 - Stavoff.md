[[The Bakers]] have just arrived at [[Stavoff]] a small town / region that used to be populated by a large community of individuals keeping a modest life, growing and selling produce, and scavenging from the local junkyard, selling their product in [[Takonai City]]. 5 years prior however, the arrival of [[Muffin Mad Inc]] has dramatically changed the environment of [[Stavoff]]. The company has drained the underground aquefer of all of its water to fuel their muffin making enterprise, and so have prevented the growth of any local product, starving the locals. Now its a free-for-all in the stavoff region, with the community fracturing into gangs all fighting for survival in this lawless environment. Takonai city has banned its inhabitants from entering the city, for fear of them bringing their millitant ways into their much more civilised abode, and muffin mad has bought off local suppliers to not sell resources to them to prevent them from unifying and fighting back effectively against them. 

Cue the heroic actions of [[Tasti Corp]], who gladly accepted a large payment of [[Shiba Inu]] for a shipment of Explogex, of which [[RAMM Inc]] plan to use to blow a hole in the side of [[The Oasis]], and return a large amount of the water back to the ground aquifer.

If the crew are willing to help, the resistance can offer them safe protection and concealment from corporate entities, basic repair services, potential weapons upgrades, and support in their own struggle against other corporate entities. [[RAMM Inc]] employees are all trained fighters, and have a connection with [[Cathy Caldera]]. Part of the reason why Cathy was here is that she came to give them financial aid, of which they have used to purchase the explogex.

The location that the group have met RAMM Inc is a location they refer to as "[[Prosperity]]". Its few concrete husks of towers is all that remains of the old town of the same name. They use it as a resource depot, and of symbolic nature of showing what mad muffin has taken from them all.
