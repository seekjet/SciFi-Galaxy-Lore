Mr cuddles want the crew to go to the [[Kandar System]] and help [[Cathy Caldera]] get out of her current location. 
- The party do not want to take this job given the context of the situation
- They have considered taking mr cuddles back to the Kandar system so that they can understand the situation more and consider helping
- The party want to load up on a second job for the [[Kandar System]] though to make it more worth their while

Offers for jobs will come in from a couple other people
An intelligence agent from contispex will want to know what is going on within rejos terminal, and needs access to the station, though needs no trace of him getting on board, so will need pickup from a remote location

Corpo wants something moved off of the books.


[[Jazt Pitol]] has taken over Iltza's old portfolio of clients, and is now responsible for getting them their goods, and keeping them happy. He gets his secretary [[Terry]] to organize these deliveries.
He needs three different off the books deliveries to be performed:
1. A delivery of "Worklife" and "Z-Juice" to [[Tk'kl'kch]] an employee of [[Lochses Archol]] at [[Warehouse District 68]]. He would like the delivery as soon as possible, and he would like to avoid the import dues associated with the drinks.
2. A delivery of Specialty Explogex to [[Soos]] at [[Stavoff]]. Explogex has been getting increasingly popular over the past couple months, its always been popular with 'Resistance' Companies. The fact the explosive looks like a drink and can be easy to smuggle under an untrained eye obviously would have no correlation. Most companies have banned the distribution of the drink within their premises and territories, for its obvious use in terrorist-related activities.
3. [[Klök]] of [[Klök's Kleaning Co.]] needs some incredibly strong acids delivered to their place of business on [[Helvetica Station]]. For potential safety concerns such acids are a restricted item on the station. of which [[Klök]] does not have a permit, as his permit was revoked a long time ago.

Tasti corp smuggling in goods for one of their clients.
Pickup will be a tasti distribution center. A sales rep will be present and wanting to escort the cargo.
Dropoff will be in a location that is heavily guarded, regulated, and scrutinized, requires a permit that the players will not have, and will not be able to acquire.
