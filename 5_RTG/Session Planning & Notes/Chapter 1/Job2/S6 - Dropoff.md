the group have taken on two kinds of jobs

the first is of a job for terry. delivery of tasti products to three clients, all of which have restrictions to the import of these products

the second and the one they are going to do first is a job from [[Guillem Le Trange]].
Guillem wants them to pickup 6 people from the local system at coordinates specified by them 5 minutes before pickup, to rejos terminal.

This job will be for 5 [[Gharad PetroChem]] special operatives to infiltrate the station with the PLA scapegoat, and have them found and shot by other vacationing Gharad Petrochem security officers shortly after another explosion. This will thus push for the lack of ability for [[ConSec]] further, and will lead to [[Gharad PetroChem]] pushing for the replacement of local station security with their own pmc. This group will also be looking to put down [[Javad Mosta'An]], in preparation for him spilling the beans.
Now of course contispex will disagree with the change in security measures, however rejos terminal is not a planet-side installation. It has interests by a lot of companies that all have power over how the station operates, and if contispex refuses at this point, then they will allow gharad petrochem to come in and replace them.

This is part of gharad petrochem's plan to control rejos terminal, and reduce their export fees paid to contispex by using their facility.

Meanwhile, [[Macey Green]] has learnt of [[Dr. Fyria Cordaten (Michael)]]'s bounty for 25000 MDR. She is not too suprised, and would usually drop such a thing (there are always other fish). But this woman has stirred the pot with one of Macey's biggest clients, and since callum seems to be protecting her, is the perfect justification for her planned coup. Honestly, being pushed back by callum so much so recently has left a sour taste in all of her crew's mouth, and she has convinced them that his obvious favouritism is going to sink their company. He's gotta go.

[[Tau Hong Kann]] will not have learnt of fyria's involvement of his brother's death, but will have learnt of the bounty. And honestly, this woman has been pushing the line of what is ok and not. Callum has been pushing the line. Honestly, he is fine if they both have to go, and hey, if there is a bounty for this woman, he will gladly pass some muscle over for her capture.
The only reason he hasn't learnt about [[Kaitlyn Lecial]]'s moving of his brother's body is the fact that [[Zhang Fal]] hasn't told him yet. [[Zhang Fal]] want's [[Dr. Fyria Cordaten (Michael)]] to be a good investment of his, and is happy to let her get a head start on what is to come her way. Money talks, and if she were to be removed by [[Tau Hong Kann]] then money from her will cease. That being said, he does owe [[Tau Hong Kann]] a favour, so he won't hold onto this forever. He will simply do so when she is offworld. Secondly, this will affect [[Kaitlyn Lecial]], of which he can protect, in order to ensure [[Dr. Fyria Cordaten (Michael)]] will continue to conduct business with him.
