The players return in the process of dropping off the hospital patients and staff aboard the [[RLS Illumination]].
The ship will tether itself to [[Rejos Terminal]], providing auxilliary power and assistance for repair of its critical infrastructure. It will also offer its highly trained security personnel to assist in preventing any follow up attacks in the immediate future.
Funnily enough, a couple of [[Redline Security Specialists]] officers would have been on vacation on [[Rejos Terminal]] during the time of the previous bombing, managing to kill the perpetrator, one [[Shae Hjarsk]], a known activist of the [[People's Liberation Army]]. Unfortunately they were unable to defuse the bomb she had planted in time however, and [[ConSec]] security forces were not responding to their distress call over the radio before the bomb went off.
The whole thing screams negligence from consec, who allowed this terrorist aboard their station, allowed them to bomb multiple locations, and were unable to learn anything about the attacks prior to [[Redline Security Specialists]] officer's intervention.

There will be plenty of reporters upon their arrival who will have a multitude of questions for the heroes, digging for any story they could find, things like:
- Who are you?
- Why lend their assistance with their own initiative under such dangerous circumstances?
- What are their thoughts on the terrorist involved?
- Is this the end of the attacks by the [[People's Liberation Army]]?
- Do you think the risk you took in moving all the patients and staff was justified considering there was no threat to them had they simply stayed in place?
- how did you ensure the safety of the patients and staff given such a chaotic evacuation?
- What do you believe were the main causes of PLA operatives being able to infiltrate not just Rejos Terminal, but also such a sensitive and restricted area as the power plant?
- Do you believe Consec's lack of vigilance led to this scenario?
- If security were better trained for such acts of insurrection and terrorism, do you believe this scenario could have been prevented?
- There are reports that Consec officers ordered the grounding of all spacecraft just prior to your evactuation, did that make your evacuation harder?
- How are you and the rest of your crew handling such a high stress situation?
- What resources if made available, would have made the evacuation of the patients and hospital staff easier?

[[Nick Vale]] will be shaken from the experience but will ultimately be ok. He and [[Min Jai Yun]] will thank the group for getting them off of the station in a situation that was clearly a crisis. They will be unable to give any monetary reward, as they are unsure as to the state of their business at the moment, though they will happily let some other business owners in similar industry know about the crew of the OSB, and will be able to provide the crew with a name and location of the closest Astromechanic to a point when asked.

Given half a day, the public backlash from the incident will be enough that Rejos Terminal's Station Operations Manager will make a press release that the Consec officers they employ do not have the adequate training or experience in maintaining a sufficient level of scrutiny over Rejos Terminal and its inhabitants, and so for the interim period all security operations will be handed over to [[Redline Security Specialists]], as they have so kindly offered to temporarily assist us in dealing with this crisis. The majority of Consec officers will be transferred planetside until further notice.

[[Fran Vale]] will want to speak with the party immediately when she learns of their arrival just prior to the incident. She wants to know why they arrive just in the nick of time again. She passed them over last time, giving them the benefit of the doubt of their involvement, but now she is not so sure. Unfortunately her jurisdiction is running out so she needs to get this info ASAP. She will be emotional, as she is facing the prospect of her family breaking up, and not seeing either her brother or her grandfather again. She played her company line, favoring her local inhabitants and tried to be a good cop, and now her world is falling apart, and she is being kept from trying to make it whole again.

A Dt'tka [[Redline Security Specialists]] officer, [[Gl'Klch'Rd]] will make contact with the crew and ask for an interview with them. This is a lawful order disguised as a request. Their purpose is to see if the party will give up any information in regards to the squadron they just transported. Questions they will ask:
- Do you recognize this woman? holding a picture of [[Shae Hjarsk]]
- What were your intentions coming to Rejos terminal? Any other business aside from your stated reason?
- The [[BSS Only Slightly Bent]] has been involved in criminal activity in the past. Smuggling, thievery, unlawful evasion

[[Vicky Marr]] will ask to be dropped off with her friend [[Orson Waltz]] of [[Rigor Mortis]]. She has just gone through a breakup with [[Sibyl Smith]], hence why she was not at her apartment for the night, and doesn't really feel comfortable going back there immediately.

[[Ethan Chao]] will ring panini up and will warn him not to return, take the [[BSS Only Slightly Bent]] and leave for another system. [[Macey Green]] has taken over Bai Seng with [[Tau Hong Kann]]'s blessing, and technically the [[BSS Only Slightly Bent]] belongs to her now. Right now [[Macey Green]] is expecting the crew to return upon the completion of a job, and will ambush them along with a contingent of [[Tau Hong Kann]]'s men. [[Tau Hong Kann]] has interest in [[Dr. Fyria Cordaten (Michael)]], it's unclear what Macey wants to do with the rest of the crew.
If asked, he hasn't seen the new girl, [[Kaitlyn Lecial]], since before the party's departure. He will ask why they are worrying about her as he is not aware of her relationship with Fyria.
