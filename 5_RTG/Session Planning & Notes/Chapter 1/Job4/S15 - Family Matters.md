[[Junebug]]

[[Nl'Tk'Mch'Shlet]] wants to meet iltza's new crew, and get a grasp on their competency. she wants to know if iltza is actually useful or not.
Having a discrete transport crew on call is a good asset to have. Nl'Tk'Innitz may want to use their services to steal some trade secrets from [[Contispex Pharmaceuticals]] for [[Better Inc.]]. [[Doctor Tokovsky]] who also works for [[Better Inc.]] would know exactly what he wants, having learnt about [[Dr. Fyria Cordaten (Michael)]] from his own company. He would also be interested in obtaining this woman for her insight into the next generation of genome altering drugs.
