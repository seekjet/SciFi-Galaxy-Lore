The crew are heading back to Kandar to take on the job from [[Koyorin Machi]].

Koyorin, along with [[Dai Fang]] will be going to [[Dreams and Beams]], a fabrication company operated by the criminal syndicate, the [[San Zhao Triad]].

[[Cathy Caldera]] is being kept ajacent to the galvanization floor, in old equipment storage. She is being kept there and questioned in a room that used to be an old RF testing room, but has since been modified into a holding cell. The metal lining of the walls prevent escape.

The structure of the session will go as follows:

introduction to the place, koyorin and associates will meet with [[Max]], [[Claudia]], and a number of other members of the [[San Zhao Triad]].


## Infiltration
The session today will be abouty management of the 3 clocks labelled "Alarm", "Interest", and "'Spicious".

If at any moment "Alarm" strikes midnight, the alarm will be raised for unauthorised access into the building, security will become far more active, and will begin attacking those they see as threats.

If at any moment "'Spicious" reaches midnight, the San Zhao Triad will believe that Koyorin's group are trying to do something other than inspect and purchase artwork, and will most likely attempt to detain them.

"Interest" indicates the amount of interest the [[San Zhao Triad]] members have in Koyorin's group. The more interest the members have, the more scrutiny will be placed on koyorin's group, and the less scrutiny will be placed on other sections of the facility.

For every deviation of "interest" from the 6 o'clock position to the anticlockwise, the Koyorin group will receive a +1 bonus on rolls made to avoid suspicion, and a -1 penalty will be applied to any rolls made to not raise the alarm level in other parts of the facility.

For every deviation of "interest" from the 6 o'clock position to the clockwise, a +1 bonus will be applied to any rolls made to not raise the alarm level in the facility, and a -1 penalty will be applied to any rolls made to avoid suspicion with the Koyorin group.
