![[chameleon serum.png]]
Requires:
Catalyctic Biomass
Harmonic genetic inhibitors
Telomeric simulant immunosuppressants

requires access to exotic chemicals and biomass for protein and genetic extraction
Synthesized from materials costing 300 MDR (Grade 1), 400 MDR (Grade 2), 600 MDR (Grade 3) 1000 MDR (Grade 4)
Production requires constant attention to keep reactions in check as the formula synthesizes, takes 1 days for grade 1, 2 days for grade 2, 3 days for grades 3 and 4. Once synthesized, the dosages must be allowed to develop for a further 3 days before being taken, though this does not require attention.
Expiry is a month after production

requires access to machines that can monitor chemical levels, apply specific dosages of ingredients, and apply accurate and quick heating/cooling within the serum (ie a proper medical laboratory)

making larger batches of more than one serum's worth simultaneously is possible, though increases chance of apparent or unapparent failure that if taken will produce side-affects
