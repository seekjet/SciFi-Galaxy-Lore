Their character started in sales in a trading company, got rather good at it
transferred to some less than legal aspects of the company.
Talking with less than legal conencitons, backalley trades, etc (arms, restricted materials, people?), built connections in that manner

one of these dealings got caught by a security force, zack's char was thrown under the bus.

lost their job and reputation, unable to get a steady job now, and have found their way down to plaza 8.

came here for grunt work (working at the factories), though hates the work, meets an old work acquaintance, and gets pushed to [[Callum Galgreaves]] for alternate work.



Boss planned to have employee get caught, created scenario wherein his subordinates can prove ruthlessness by turning on someone else

Boss and peer are both bad guys



need to know matriarch and several other members of the family.

has never killed anyone, but might consider it for enough financial compensation.


prologue could be of them trying to survive their first night on the streets of plaza 8. (linked to just trying to get by) Can be welcomed in by strangers and potentially assist them not getting in trouble when the popo come knocking for contraband. (meet an agent of the resistance here, who can forward them on to callum at the end)
