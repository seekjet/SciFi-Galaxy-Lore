will be a prologue of them doing their final mission with their company before being mutated into bird person

question that is asked is what are the long term effects of their final job? what will this mean for the story at large?
how are they able to deal with the brutality of it so non-chalanty?

could hint towards mergers and aquisitions - one company's aggression / hostile takeover of another, or requisition of desired people/things

Will masig be able to overcome his bouts of uncontrollable violence?

The Magna clock.
This clock has 4 segments. For every stress Masig takes, he fills in one segment.
Hitting a nail for a minute winds the clock back one segment.
If the clock becomes full, Masig loses control of himself, succumbing to the effects of the magna serum.
Temporarily the following effects occur:
his clever is reduced to zero, adding its prior value to his forceful score
his sneaky is reduced to zero, adding its prior value to his flashy score
his careful is reduced to zero, adding its prior value to his quick score
his mind regresses to a state of extreme anger or fear, responding to the stimuluses that have caused stress to him this scene with violence.
He recovers once the sources of stress dealt to him this scene have been sufficiently nullified so that they cannot cause further stress to himself for this scene, or he is unable to cause harm to the sources of stress for a minute.
When he recovers, his approaches revert to their values before the transformation, and the clock resets to an empty state.

Origin Story: Guard Detail
Posted to protect off-grid medical/science facility
Something goes wrong (unknown, mutants escaping? Damaged facility? Faulty equipment?)
Trying to help scientists/corpos escape, fire/explosion/etc, going room to room with squad, enter
into high clearance lab, large vats of unknown liquid (green? Blue? yellow?), large panels of
equipment, lights everywhere, sudden power outage, lights go out, emergency lights go on, vats
overheat, instrument panels spark, gas is released into the room, squad quickly puts on masks
but definitely inhaled some prior, symptoms show as slight dizziness and blurred vision, this
passes quickly.
Rush to escape with survivors, squad intact, hear/encounter “creatures” on the way out, gunfire,
they are deterred/run away, unsure if dead, don’t care. Scientists/corpos run ahead, squad stay
back to guard retreat, hear machine gun fire from outside, move to viewpoint, see current gen
gunships (hover tech etc) laying waste to any who leave by front entrance.
We take a detour, time to go, not paid enough for this clean sweep shit, was briefed on layout of
facility prior to mission, including sewer access, dive back into facility, head down, then down
again, exit unguarded, squad finds themselves far outside the boundary undetected. Decide to
split up for safety, will be in contact if possible, lay low for now, assume company thinks we’re
dead, facility goes up in flames behind us (very cinematic).
Don’t go home, don’t contact anyone, secure passage off world, keep moving, getting sick, see
changes in body, growths etc, eyesight improves (low light/night vision, greater detail), reactions
improve (higher reflexes, catch dropped/thrown items easier, analyse environment faster),
strength improves (was always biggest in the squad, estimate 2-3x increase in general strength,
can lift/push more)
Temper worsens, prone to mood swings, had quit smoking, pick it up again, seems to calm
nerves, can’t stop now, “I don’t think you heard me, I NEED a smoke”
New world, shopkeep tries to con me, said I hadn’t paid, definitely had, break his arm, didn’t see
it happen, didn’t mean to, take my shit and leave.
New city, see two/three men threatening a woman in an alley, intervene, they get physical, knife,
gun, didn’t matter, they’re dead, came to with blood everywhere, organs on the ground, she’s
screaming, say it’s ok, I’m sorry, she runs, left her bag, need the money anyway, not proud of it
but take the creds and post the rest to the local law.
Time to leave again, arms and legs scaly now, raised edges, don’t know if it’s bone or armor,
reminds of that animal from Terra, croc-something? No sharp teeth though, though they’re
definitely stronger, got hit with a bat, bat chipped, teeth are fine, swinger not so much. It’s like a
rash, think it’s getting worse, gotta find more smokes.
Keep changing towns, cities, worlds, find myself here, met a guy, or he found me, don’t know
which. Said I’d had military training, wait no, I never told him, somehow he knew, it’s fine, I didn’t
confirm, should be far enough away by now anyway. He said I’d get a new squad, real misfit
band, all lost, he gave them a home, better than nothing I guess. Besides, I’m out of creds,
mutation has slowed down, can’t run out of smokes though, it’s always there, waiting, just below
the surface,
Shit who’s leg do I gotta break for a nail? (smoke/cigarette/coffin nail) Sorry, I don’t mean
to snap, I’m a nice guy, really.
Bio:
Name’s Sig, short for Masig, Masig Tern, once from Mars, not there anymore, had to get away.
Used to head up a fiver, that’s a five man squad. It’s how they managed us, sometimes we’d be
grouped up with others, “send ten fivers” they’d say, full company, when you needed shit done.
It always went back to us five though, you live together, eat together, and yeah, even sleep
together, not like that though heh.
Anyway, I was lead, quick on my feet, always got a plan, started out in comms after grunt
training, in charge of radio coz I knew my numbers. That was till they saw me slipping in my own
orders, would’ve gotten cut, if it weren’t for the fact my calls were always good. Save enough
men, eventually they give you some of your own, knew who I wanted so that was fine by me.
Old Squad:
Bill “Bullet” Fadder
There was myself, then Bill, though we called him Bullet, you know, Bullet Bill? Nevermind. He
always dropped the most rounds during any mission, loved that minigun, logistics didn’t
appreciate the cost though.
Alfred “Ted” Signer
Next was Ted, big softy, real name Alfred, was everyone’s friend, could beat anyone in an arm
wrestle though, the arms on that guy.
Feng “Chopper” Zaido
We had Chopper next, real name Feng, Chop could fly anything, though he didn’t get chopper
from those old school spinning blade flight craft, he just loved cooking. Still remember diving
behind the couch first time I head him chopping veg, sounded like machine gun fire. Did I
mention he’s got a bionic arm?
Quinn “Tophat” Bartlett
Lastly there was Tophat, or just Hat, or Hatty, Atty, Hatter, The Mad Hatter, real character, why
we call him Tophat? Coz he found this old fashioned helmet on tour once, looked like something
out of a museum, definitely not standard issue, but he swore by it, “they don’t make em like this
anymore!” he’d say. But it’s fine, he was our marksman anyway, not like he was often in the line
of fire. Still, thing looked ridiculous, like a salad bowl on his goofy head.
Last word:
And that was us, well not anymore, no clue where they went, hope they’re safe, laying low. Still,
I got a bone to pick with those that broke up our happy family, there’s some heads I’d like to taer
off and smash into the steel deck like ripe melons and…sorry, don’t know why I said…what was
I saying? Right, what’s the job? I got energy and smokes to burn.
