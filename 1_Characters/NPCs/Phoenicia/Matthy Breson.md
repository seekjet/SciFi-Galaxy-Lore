Name - Matthy Breson
Location - Phoenicia System, Nivabhumir (unsure if Contispex location)
Description - Matthy is a typical Martian native, 5'8" with black hair, short 'n' wavy. His eyes are dark but friendly, used to smiling. The company uniform he's wearing is clean and well kept, though worn casual like he just got off work. On first glance he might appear to be relaxed, but his eyes never stop moving, well trained, observant.
