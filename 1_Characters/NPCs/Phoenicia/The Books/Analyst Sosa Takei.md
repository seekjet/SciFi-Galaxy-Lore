Caphrian, takes the holographic form of a female of japanese decent, 24 years of age, neat shoulder length blue hair, shoulder length, not a strand out of place. wears professional military dress uniform, a smile like she has caught you in the act of doing something naughty, and a stance that positions herself as an authoritative figure.

Sosa works for [[Contispex Pharmaceuticals]] cybersecurity department, leading team protecting classified information and monitoring [[The Books]]' electronic systems and sensors for hostile threats.

She knows fleshy people are unreliable, and untrustworthy. They lie and cheat and steal, and she is going to stop them from doing that. She can stop them before they have even realised it. She is faster than everyone. Incessently curious, wondering why people do the things they do, especially self-destructive things.
