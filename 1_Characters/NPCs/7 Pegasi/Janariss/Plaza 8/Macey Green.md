![[Macey Green Cropped Altered.png|300]]

Captain of the [[BSS Avaricious]]. Playful, avaricious, ambitious, ruthless. No job is too dirty for her and her crew. Mutant, reptillian, martian. Taller than average, her genome mixed with reptillian dna. A through and through psycopath.

Born and raised in the depths of plaza 8, she has the ambition to own it all, control it all.

Macey was brought on to the crew of [[Yajlib Alhuriya]] as a prodigy. She learnt how to survive, and get ahead from all the rest. She disliked how compassionate Yajlib was, and thought that they could easily be making so much more. Eventually the amount of opportunities that she passed up was too much for macey, and she set up the firebird's downfall. Callum does not know of her direct involvement, and macey knows that if he were to know then he would hate her, which she does not want. Truely, she wants him to see her as Yajlib did, with love and support. But he doesnt see her in that way. To some extent callum has seen through her disguise, and knows what she is. He can't bring himself to intervene with how bad macey has gotten though as he does not want to hurt this person his wife cared about.

Macey is furious that panini gets more attention from callum than she does, and she tries harder and harder to bring in the recognition that she feels she deserves, and the lack of recognition is killing her.

Macey became the captain of the Avaricious after the removal of its captain [[Duan Bai Seng]], as callum removed him from the company.
