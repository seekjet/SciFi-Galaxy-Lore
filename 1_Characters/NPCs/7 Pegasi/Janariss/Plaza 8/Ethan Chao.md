![[Ethan Cho.png|300]]

Ex captain of the [[BSS Only Slightly Bent]], only other crew member to survive panini's first incident. Has a good relationship with both [[Callum Galgreaves]] and [[Panini (Cat)]].

**

The Captain of Panini’s first real crew, the sole survivor (apart from Panini) who was arrested. He was released a few months back, and came to work for Cal. He refuses to be a captain again after the absurdity of how the last crew he had turned out, but will do the occasional piloting, as he was capable of doing both. 

He prefers to work making forgeries now, creating false logs or cargo reports and is pretty good at it having not just experience as a smuggler himself, but having previously worked in law enforcement and being taught what to look out for.

He’s resilient, and not someone who gets traumatised or upset easily, the entire affair with the crew he was in with Panini mostly was just exhausting to him, he wasn’t particularly worried by the events.

He’s a friendly guy, and has a natural charisma to him fitting of his previous role as a Captain and pilot. 

He’s Panini's first real experience with seeing how non-Lumen age, since Panini sees most other people, like Cal, frequently and only usually sees small changes in their physical appearance over time, unlike the several year gap between seeing Ethan again. The reunion was a pleasant one, and if Panini is stuck hanging around and not kept on the ship, he’ll sometimes hang out in Ethan’s office, sometimes to chat, but more often to just sit there and listen to the ex-captain talk to himself like some kind of rubber duck to a programmer. Panini will usually just melt in the corner and chill.
