Mr. Li is an investigator/hunter of anti-corporate terrorists. His job is to seek out those extremists that disrupt the profit margin of large companies, and acts as a contractor for his parent company.

He is an [[ORBIS]] field operative, a reliable asset that has been applied to seek out the gang of terrorists organised by [[Cathy Caldera]] by any means necessary, avoiding collateral damage where possible.
He has been given access to organizing any crews of local tactical teams when available, and prefers to let them take the final catches. He works better when gathering information, or interrogating his quarry.

He does not care for your morals, or ideals. He does not care if you are a model citizen or not. He has a goal, and he will accomplish it.

He is a Caphrian. He wants to perfect the art of the hunt, and his job gives him this perfect opportunity.

Considering the vast amount of wealth and resources within the company backing him, he has access to a lot of goodies.
He has created a chassis that mimics the build of a Martian, and allows for adjustments to height, weight, and build, also allowing for the sections of skin panels to be replaced so that he can change his visual appearance from job to job.

In his private life, the Mr. Li refers to himself as Wei Jiren (great hunter) (Mr Wei)



Mr. Li has recently heard of the wrecked ship the "Killing Time". The ship was originally planned to be ambushed and its occupants apprehended, however they were killed in some freak accident. He knows that the ship has ties to terroristic activity, and wants to apprehend whoever claims any critical parts from the ship. 

When kailey's character nabbed the SpACU, he learnt that she had arranged a meeting with a buyer, who knew exactly what he was buying. The individual has identified themselves as Ms. Vesper Lynd ([[Magenta Punch]]).

He is of the belief that Ms. Lynd is part of an organised extremist cell, considering her decent skill in covering her tracks, and is of the belief that with the apprehension of her, he will be able to learn her contacts, and have a leg up in hunting for more of her kind.

To that end, he has organised a local sting team to apprehend both kailey's character, Ms. Lynd, and anyone else that attends their trade.
