Happened to get ahold of [[Cathy Caldera]] recently, as she tried to interfere with the gang attempting to capture another [[People's Liberation Army]] member, [[Cindred Erdogan]]

a runner for [[Claudia]] met with [[Nl'tk'iltza (Zack)]] at [[Plaza 8]] as claudia wanted to get a particular compound from [[Tasti Corp]], with the [[Hoàng Thảo Nghi]]'s blessing, though [[Terry]] believes that [[Jazt Pitol]] sold out this deal to get [[Nl'tk'iltza (Zack)]] fired.

This runner is named [[Moronica]].
