A Shrine dedicated to multiple kami of the Shinto Faith. Dozens are enshrined here, each with their own section set aside for the kami, with a stone carved statue representing the kami at each, with other decorations and offerings more specific to the kami adorning their place of enshrinement.

Major Kami Worshipped Here:



[[Inari Okami]] - The lady of agriculture, rice, foxes, fertility, alcohol, and industry
- This would be the biggest section in the shrine, with the most offerings being made to

[[Sarutahiko Ōkami]] - The lord of earthly kami. He represents strength, guidance, and cleanliness/purification, and is also the patron of martial arts
- he is the husband of [[Ame-no-Uzume]], and the head of the [[Sarume Clan]]

[[Ame-no-Uzume]] - The lady of revelry, meditation, mirth, and the arts
- She created the [[Kagura]], a ceremonial dance in which the performers are attempting to entertain the gods. One major function of kagura is chinkon (purifying and shaking the spirit), involving a procession-trance process. Usually a female shaman will perform the dance and obtain the oracle from the god—in the setting, the dancer herself turns into the god during the performance. This process can be used as a means to communicate with the spirits.

[[Amaterasu Omikami]] - the great lady - the god of the sun - the ruler of the heavens - god of leadership and law

Smaller:
[[Ame-no-Minakanushi]] - The first kami of existence - primordial
- [[Sun Shuren]] would reccomend to sig to practice worship especially to a one of his component parts: [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi]], the August star of heaven, the god of heavenly chaos and disorder. A rebellious kami who does not submit to the will of other kami
