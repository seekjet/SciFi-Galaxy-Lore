There are two major types of _kagura_: _mai_ and _odori_. _Mai_ consists of slow circular movement, stressing quiet and elegance, while _odori_ consists of quick leaping and jumping, stressing activation and energy. The two types can be understood as two phases of _kagura_: _mai_ is a preparation process for trance and _odori_ is the unconscious trance stage.

During _mai_, the female shaman, surrounded by a group of priests, holds a _[gohei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gohei "Gohei")_ (a ceremonial wand used to cleanse or purify) as well as sound-producing instruments and engages with circling movement to summon deities. Once the female shaman enters a possessed state, she switches into the spontaneous leaping movements of _odori_.
