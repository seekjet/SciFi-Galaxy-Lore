WH40K army - the orks

Geerten is 27

Her two kids are [[Kinuani Samba]] (12 M) and [[Yudi Samba]] (6M) She adopted them two years ago after their mother, and her friend, [[Nsona Samba]] died in a hit-and-run accident. She went to high school with their mother, then studied accounting at university. She got through that worked for a couple years at [[Better Inc.]] though she was not happy, and the work did not fulfill her, and fed up with helping a supercorp get richer to increase a number in a bank account, she left and applied to [[Takonai Domestic Protection]]. During her initial academy traineeship, her friend died, and she stopped for a period of time to help support her friend's kids, and help them deal with the grief and trauma they sustained from that incident. 9 Months ago she was able to start the traineeship again, and only 2 months ago has her training shifted from academy based book learning to street patrols.
