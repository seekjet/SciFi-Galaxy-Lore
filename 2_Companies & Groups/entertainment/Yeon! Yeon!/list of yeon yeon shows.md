[[Clara Sinclair]] - Mutant Martian - [[Presponite System]] - undisclosed location - Could talk with the dead, have them speak back audibly, most of them intelligible, though some responses sounded very much like human speech.

[[Magic Mike]] - Martian - [[Kandar System]] - [[Takonai City]] - Predominant part of show was showing off telekinesis, though could vaporize objects, and perform flashing lightshows too

[[Kurt Pomeranian]] - Trappian - Phoenicia System - Weird person, seemed incredibly inviting to Choi, welcoming him into his home, that appeared to be overgrown with weird snaking tendrils, had a smile plastered on him and deep black under-skin veins bulging at the surface. Had a pleasant conversation with choi talking about his abilities, though seemed to get snappy when choi compared him to some other wizards, got violent and lashed out with incredible strength, throwing equipment through a steel wall. Composed themselves and told themselves that everything was alright, and these kind people were here to talk with him, give him company, and have a good time. Choi wrapped up the episode quickly and excused himself from the man's abode

[[Dai Wuxian]] - Mutant Martian - Uunda Kujarra System - imbued their skin with magic so that gunfire could not pierce it

[[Rc'xdid'bl]] - Vk'dxud -[[Inie]] System - Could make plants grow at exceptional rate, and could control vines like they were extensions of their body. Had an extraordinary garden around them, some plants had interesting black growths on them. Seemed to be so happy that their matriarch was happy at their skills.

[[Chen Hui]] - Martian - Psi Serpentis System - Transformed herself into the form of an animal (a large python in this case), for clarity, did also transform herself back

[[Fighter 3000]] - Martian - [[HD3166]] System - Blurred face on camera. Able to make herself invisible, able to conjure small lights, seemed rather new to the whole thing. Seemed to want to answer questions from [[Choi Kwan Yeon]] in more depth, though stopped herself frequently.

[[Glen Van Dragan]] - Trappian - Valar Aster System - Weird episode, featured a number of people who knew Van Dragan rather than the man himself, all being fully blurred and voices changed. Apparently Van Dragan knew [[Choi Kwan Yeon]] was coming, and the hunter that followed after him, and didn't want to be here when they both arrived. Choi was surprised as he doesn't announce to anyone where his episodes are to be shot as he doesn't want to show these people's private lives, and anything they don't want on camera, he will remove. Interested by this comment on the "hunter" the associates of Van Dragan told him where and when he would be able to spot him, and what he would look like. Choi got a brief shot of this man passing by on a streetway exactly as the people said, and quickly left the system after that.

[[Pd'dok]] - Vk'dxud - [[PSR B1257+12 (Lich)]] System - Could shift earth like someone molds clay, very useful for his family's mining business. All of his family are terrified of him, though he seems super friendly.
