**[Radio Jingle Plays]**

**Both**: Hi everyone!

**Cathy:** You're listening to FX-197J, the home of 'Colour out of Space!'. This is Cathy Caldera, wishing you health and happiness as always! With me, of course, is everyone's favorite co-host, Mr. Cuddles. How are you feeling today, Mr. Cuddles?

**Mr. Cuddles:** I'm feeling great! But, um, I heard some really scary news about Rejos Terminal. Can we talk about that?

**Cathy:** We can.. For those who might not know, there was a terrible bombing at Rejos Terminal recently. A small number of people have died, and a large number have been badly hurt. Our hearts go out to all the victims and their families, and we would ask our listeners to support them in their time of pain.

**Mr. Cuddles:** Thatâ€™s really upsetting. The.. I heard people saying that the People's Liberation Army was responsible for it. Which can't be true..

**Cathy:** Your right. The People's Liberation Army has been wrongly blamed for this attack. I want to assure everyone that our group had absolutely no hand in this.

**Mr. Cuddles:** Which leads me to ask why would people say that the People's Liberation Army did it?

**Cathy:** It's a complex situation. Sometimes, since we are a group that stand up for the underprivileged and the oppressed, we are targeted and blamed for things that we haven't done. Because we're an easy target for that, and we struggle to fight that image because we don't have a voice in mainstream media.

**Mr. Cuddles:** This is why we don't broadcast over radio waves right? Because then they would find us.. Because then we would get tracked and caught and punished and forced to give out the names of our other members and tested on and..

**Cathy:** Whoa whoa whoa. Calm down buddy. Calm down.. We're safe here. Yes. This is why we broadcast in the way we do. So they can't find us. But there are other people out there not like us. People who are oppressed, taken advantage of, and are unable to speak out in fear of corporate reprisal. All we are about is helping people get by in a galaxy that is *hard* to live in. We believe in compassion, support, freedom of mind and body, and making positive changes to people's lives, not violence.

**Mr. Cuddles:** We would never do something like a bombing. We want to create a better, safer galaxy for everyone. Making a statement by hurting people goes against everything we believe in..
But then, why are we being blamed? Who could have done it?

**Cathy:** To be honest, I don't know. There are many forces and factions at play in the galaxy, and sometimes those who wish to see us fail will spread false information, or use our censored public image as a scapegoat to cover their own acts. If I were to make a bet though, I'd say it'd be a large company, or powerful person, who wasn't happy with the status quo. If they were looking to make radical changes by upsetting the public, this would be a good way to do so.

**Mr. Cuddles:** So, what can our listeners do to help?

**Cathy:** You can stay informed, ask questions, and support one another. Record these broadcasts and, if its safe to do so, share them with those that need help, or want to help. Remember that we are a network, and these transceivers are untraceable and two-way; If something important is happening in your area, tell us. We will talk about it on our show, and try and organize others to come and assist. Keep spreading kindness and care, and don't let fear or misinformation divide us. By standing up when we are able, we can not only have a life we are proud of, but inspire others to live too.

**Mr. Cuddles:** Thanks mum. I'm still sad about the bombing, but I'm also relieved to know we didn't have anything to do with it.

**Cathy**: Anytime, Mr. Cuddles (busy squishing his face in her hands). Alright! lets do the messages.. Just one for today!

**Mr. Cuddles:** Ok! Everyone, check your inboxes!

**Cathy:** To all our listeners, thank you for tuning in. Remember, we're here for you, and together, we can make a difference to all of our worlds. As a tribute to all those hurt and lost on Rejos, I'm gonna play a song of the band 'Rigor Mortis' who are local to the terminal. Most of their work is *bravely* activistic, and tries to bring light to the issues they and others around them face. Though this song breaks that mold, and is more of a happier experience of which we can all hope for. Here is Rigor Mortis' 'The Actress'.

**Mr. Cuddles:** Stay safe everyone!
