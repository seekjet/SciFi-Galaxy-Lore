The criminal mercenary company run by [[Callum Galgreaves]].
Specializing in off-world small scale smuggling and larceny of high value goods.
The company assembles crews, then dispatches them on jobs received from their clients.

This company used to be ran by a man named [[Duan Bai Seng]], the old captain of the [[BSS Avaricious]]

Duan was removed by Callum after the loss of his wife [[Yajlib Alhuriya]], disliking the turn the company was taking to a morally unconscious entity. He appointed Duan's second in command, [[Macey Green]] to helm the [[BSS Avaricious]] in his stead.

Timeline: 

 40 y.a. Bai seng was formed by [[Duan Bai Seng]] and [[Callum Galgreaves]]
 20 y.a. [[Callum Galgreaves]] met [[Yajlib Alhuriya]] (2 Y.o)
 19 y.a. [[Yajlib Alhuriya]] brought on [[Macey Green]] and [[Faith]] to the crew of the [[BSS Firestarter]]
 19 y.a. [[Callum Galgreaves]] marries [[Yajlib Alhuriya]] upon yajlib's request for needing to get into callum's old homeland, and that was the quickest way to gain access. Callum registers the [[BSS Firestarter]] under [[Bai Seng]] for similar reasons
 15 y.a. Yajlib is caught by [[Contispex Pharmaceuticals]] security forces after being set up by [[Macey Green]], who had desire to helm the [[BSS Firestarter]] instead. Unfortunately for macey, the [[BSS Firestarter]] was very badly damaged during its last mission, and duan took macey on as a second in command on the [[BSS Avaricious]] instead. The crew agree to not talk about [[Yajlib Alhuriya]] and her exploits for their own safety
 7 y.a. [[Panini (Cat)]] is retrieved by [[Callum Galgreaves]], and callum now understands why [[Yajlib Alhuriya]] never gave up on macey and faith
 6 mo.a. unhappy with the jobs duan had been taking, the jobs duan had been requesting callum to do, and hearing the things he was getting macey and faith to do in the name of getting money, now having a panini that duan desperately wanted to sell off, and unsure of how much longer he would be able to physically do his job, callum launched a coup with macey and faith's help, killing duan, and putting macey in charge of the [[BSS Avaricious]].
