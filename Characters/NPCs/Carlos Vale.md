This man used to be a part of a military. His area of expertise was exploration and reconnaisance. He has spent a lot of time in a zero-g environment, and a lot of his muscle mass has deteriorated as a result. He left the military when he heard of his son's death to raise his grandchildren [[Nick Vale]] and [[Fran Vale]].
Strictly a bachelor. You can only really trust your comrades beside you.
